1)Pick 3 Favorite Books
I selected books from authors I've enjoyed in the past and/or found their works to be literary masterpieces. I had to go outside of my favorites in order to fulfill the requirement that at least one of the books had to have more than one author, hence why I settle for authors I admire or who wrote books I'd like.
2) TAKE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU"VE SELECTED ABOUT THE # BOOKS AND CREATE THREE SEPARTE FILES IN WHICH TO STORE THE BOOK's INFO IN
-HTML
-XML and
-JSON
3)Write R code, using your packages of choice, to load the information from each of the three sources into separate R data frames.
4. Conclusion. Are the three data frames identical?

1)Pick 3 Favorite Books
- Weaverbird by Nigerian authors :Ayodele Arigbabu, Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀, Unoma Nguemo Azuah, Khalidah Aderonke
-  Merry Sexy Christmas by  Beverly Jenkins,Kayla Perrins and Maureen Smith
- Sula by the ;iterary genuis Toni Morrison

3)
First I am going to load a mini draft of my html script to see if it load and displays a table

PACKAGES
```{r}
library(httr)
library(XML)
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
library(xml2)
library(rvest)
```


```{r}
HTMLurl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zee-Mo/Data607/main/Assignment7_Data607_Practice_html"

HTMLTABLE = read_html(HTMLurl) %>% html_table(fill = TRUE) 
HTMLTABLE = as.data.frame(HTMLTABLE, optional = TRUE)
HTMLTABLE

```
Instead of coming down vertical, the colmun values came out horiztonal
Change up
Read in Practice 2

```{r}
HTMLurl2 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zee-Mo/Data607/main/Assignment7_Praticerun2"

HTMLTABLE2 = read_html(HTMLurl2) %>% html_table(fill = TRUE) 
HTMLTABLE2 = as.data.frame(HTMLTABLE2, optional = TRUE)
HTMLTABLE2
```

```{r}
theurl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zee-Mo/Data607/main/Assign7_HTML_Script"

htmlbox = read_html(theurl) %>% html_table(fill = TRUE) 
htmlbox = as.data.frame(htmlbox, optional = TRUE)
htmlbox
```
Load and read in the XML script
```{r}
xml.url= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zee-Mo/Data607/main/Assign7_XML_script"
xml.url = GET(xml.url)
xml.url
```

I kept getting an error so I broke the code i half

I think I see the issue

```{r}
xml.url= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zee-Mo/Data607/main/Assign7_XML_script"
xml.url = GET(xml.url)
xml.url
xml.table= xmlParse(xml.url, useInternal=TRUE )
xml.table = xmlToDataFrame(xml.table)
xml.table
```

```{r}
#install.packages("rjson")
library(rjson)
```


```{r}
json_url= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zee-Mo/Data607/main/myJsonfileforWeek7"
json_df=fromJSON(file = json_url)
json_df=json_df[['library']]
json_df = as.data.frame(json_df, optional = TRUE)
json_df
```
#Change the format of my code

```{r}
json_url2= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zee-Mo/Data607/main/jsom_script_try2"
json_df2=fromJSON(file = json_url2)
json_df2=json_df2[['library']]
json_df2 = as.data.frame(json_df2, optional = TRUE)
json_df2
```

```{r}
library(stringr)
```

CONCLUSION
Are the three data frames identical?
The format, the aesthetics are similar . The differences are seen in the class types.
In the JSON file, Book number, PublicationYR and Rating are all dbl, while in the HTMl file Book Number and PublicationYR values are integers while Good reads rating value is a dbl. However, the XMl file is completely different and has Book Number, PublicationYR and Good reads rating as characters; they are seen as strings.

Now when it comes to the written script, HTMl and XML are similar because they are broken down into a hierarchy.They have a root and sub_roots under each. 
The JSON file was strictly category based. I did not separate the information in respective to the books but to the categories like “ 1stAuthor”, “Subject”, “PublicationYR” and etc

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
