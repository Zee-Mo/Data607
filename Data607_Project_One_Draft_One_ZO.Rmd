Trying to confirm the location of the dashes
#
```{r}
length(dfTournament)
```
#Trying to confirm that the dashes are in every 3rd row
```{r}
dfTournament %>%
  filter(row_number() %% 3 == 1)
```
# Well I thought it would filter to select every third row but instead it selecting every 3rd row after the 1st row which is where it says Pair|Player Name|Total |Round etc etc 

#Let's investigate this
```{r}
dfTournament %>%
  filter(row_number() %% 3 == 2)
```
# Okay so above it selected every 3rd row after the second rowÃŸ/


#Okay This is the step,
# I am going to make 2 matrices, one with the names and the total points
#The second matrice is going have the state of residency and Player's prerating
#I need to create a column for the Average Chess and a column for the number of games played.
#This can go two way, I can either count it up and create columns myself. Append column to final data frame Less stressful
#2nd way is for me to filter trough the first matrice, speficially in the lasy 7 columns for the , counting how many times a # appears = total num of games played

Make 2 matrices
```{r}
matrix1 = dfTournament %>%
  filter(row_number() %% 3 == 1)
matrix1

```{r}
matrix2 = dfTournament %>%
  filter(row_number() %% 3 == 2)
matrix2 
```

```{r}
colnames(matrix1) = c("columnone")
```

```{r}
matrix1 = matrix1 %>%
  separate(columnone,c('Pair','Player Name','Total','Round','Round','Round','Round','Round','Round','Round|'))
matrix1
```
```{r}
matrix1
```

```{r}
matrix1[c('Pair', 'Player Name','Total','Round','Round','Round','Round','Round','Round','Round')] = str_split_fixed(matrix1$columnone, ' ', 10)
```

matrix1

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
