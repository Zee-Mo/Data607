#THE GOAL IS TO:
#(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.
#You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so
#that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
#(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy
#and transform your data.
#(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
#(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative
#descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your
#homework submission:
# The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
# The URL for your rpubs.com web page.

MY PLAN:

1) Find the total number of flights for ALASKA and for AM WEST
1) Figure out the percent of aM Flights that are delayed vs On time for both airlines
1) Then combine data and get the mean,stv_dev, median for the Number of planes that were delayed and on time in total and for gene destination. Then compare where the 

A) get the number of rows by the noukbers of column
Use head() to view the first 5 rows
Use tails to view the last 5 rows
Use columns to return the names of your columns

B)IF this was python you would use describe to summarizes the count, mean 
Standard dev and min and max for the numeric variables

C)Look for discrepancies
 Min vs max, mean vs median, wide or small std dev


Indenitfy unique values in both columns and rows
D)CLEANING YOUR DATASET
- Remove redundant variables
- Remove Variable selection
- Remove outliers

```{r}

```


READ IN DATA
```{r}
flightinfo = read_csv("flightinfo_Data607_copy.csv")
```
```{r}
head(flightinfo)
```



```{r}
head(flightinfo)
```



GET THE NUMBER THE NUMBER OF COLMUNS
#I have 8 columuns and 6 rows


##I just realized I can not summarize Delayed by Airlines beacuse it its in a fdifferent lines



DESCRIBE/SUMMMARIES THE DATA

#SHORTCUT, I NEED TO LABLED THE ROW

```{r}
rownames(flightinfo) = (LETTERS[1:7] )
```

```{r}
flightinfo
```
#apparently tibble can not have custom names.We are still going to try. If I can't change the row name, then I will have to convert df to a dataframe using as.data.frame

# We re going to chnage Specific row names; modified them by specifying the index of the row we wish to modify and then assigning it to a new object value. 

```{r}
row.names(flightinfo) [2] = "Destination"
```

```{r}

```{r}
flight311 = as.data.frame(flightinfo)

#I am trying to create a data frame that basically have a column with that has 1) ontime arrivals, #2)delays arrivals, , 3) carrier ( says AMWEST or ALASKA) 4) DESINTATIONS and match 
# SO right here I am imaging that I am trying to combined AM WEST FLIGHTS on top of ALASKA. I imagine each destination would pop up twice correlating the correct ontime flights and delays flights for each respective airline to its respective destination
 
 
# HERE I have to match the names of the colmuns in order for them to bind

Q- get a summary per airline? and/or per place

```{r}
df5 %>%
  group_by(df5$ARRIVAL_DELAY) %>%
  summarize( mean_a= mean(df5$ARRIVAL_DELAY,
                          sum_a = sum(df5$ARRIVAL_DELAY)
                        ))
 

  

```

```{r}
df5 %>% 
  group_by(df5$ARRIVAL_DELAY,df5$CARRIER) %>%
  summarize()

```

```{r}
skim(df5)
```

```{r}
df5 %>%
  group_by(CARRIER)

```
```{r}
df5 %>%

  group_by(ARRIVAL_DELAY) %>%
  summarize( mean = mean(df5$ARRIVAL_DELAY), max = max(df5$ARRIVAL_DELAY), std = sd(df5$ARRIVAL_DELAY))

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
