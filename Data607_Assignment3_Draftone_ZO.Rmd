Introduction:
  I do know the objective of this week
  This week is about character strings and dates, speifically manipulating R character and date processing

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Question 1 
College Major 
- #1. Using the 173 majors listed in fivethirtyeight.comâ€™s College Majors dataset [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/], provide code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"

#Read and upload the csv file of the college major list
```{r}
collegemajors = read.csv( "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/2d2ff3e9457549d51f8e571c52099bfe9b2017ad/college-majors/majors-list.csv")
```

Now select for majors with Data or STATISTICS
```{r}
grep(pattern = "DATA|STATISTICS", collegemajors$Major, value= TRUE )
```

Question 2
#2 Write code that transforms the data below:
#[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"
#[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  
#[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    
#[13] "olive"        "salal berry"
#Into a format like this:
#c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry")

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r}
fruit = c(
'[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"
[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  
[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    
[13] "olive"        "salal berry" ' )
```

VIEW
```{r}
fruit
```

#NEED TO REMOVE [1] [5] [9] [13 and the \]

```{r}
library(stringr)
```


```{r}
newfruitv1= str_remove_all(string=fruit, pattern="\"")
```

```{r}
newfruitv1= str_remove_all(string=fruit, pattern="[1]")
```


```{r}
fruit
```

```{r}
fruit3 = gsub('\"', '', fruit, fixed=TRUE)
fruit3
```

#getting ride of number5,9,13 and 1 one-by-one
```{r}
fruit3 = gsub('\n[5]', "", fruit3, fixed=TRUE)
fruit3
```

```{r}
fruit3 = gsub('\n[9]', "", fruit3, fixed=TRUE)
fruit3
```

```{r}
fruit3 = gsub('\n[13]', "", fruit3, fixed=TRUE)
fruit3
```



#I want to get ride of  backslash and numbers in less moves than what it took to mke fruit3
```{r}
fruit2 = gsub("[^A-Za-z0-9]", ".", fruit)
fruit2
```

```{r}
fruit2 = gsub('[0-9]+', '', fruit2)
fruit2
```

FOUND THE PATTERN
```{r}
str_view_all(fruit2,"\\W")
```
#THANKKKKKK YOU JESUS

#Trying to figure out how to replace all the noncharcter white space with " " and not get backslah

```{r}
fruits2update = str_replace_all(fruit2,"\\W", ' "')
fruits2update

```
```{r}
fruits2update = str_replace_all(fruit2,"\\W",  " '")
fruits2update
```
# Okay, I'm going to go back to the orginal and leave as it for my answer 2

```{r}
fruits2update = str_remove(fruit2,"\\W")
fruits2update
```

```{r}
#fruits2update = str_remove_all(fruit2,".")
#fruits2update
```

#OPPPPPS
#Go BACK to fruit2 as answer
```{r}
fruit2
```



```{r}
fruit_list = as.list(fruit2)
fruit_list
```



```{r}
fruit5 = gsub("\\\\", " ",fruit)
fruit5
```

```{r}
```

Question 3


#3 Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:
#(.)\1\1
#"(.)(.)\\2\\1"
#(..)\1
#"(.).\\1.\\1"
#"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"

Testing string
```{r}
input_string = "abc"
matches = str_extract_all(input_string,"(.)\1\1")
matches
```
```{r}
strings= c("aaa", "111", "&&&", "abb", "abccba", "xyz", "xyyzz", "(.)\\1\\1")
matches2= str_extract_all(strings, "(.)\\1\\1" )
matches2
```

```{r}
strings3 = c("abba", "cccc","chhc","papa","paap","coco","church","yaya","yaay")
matches3 = str_extract_all(strings3, "(.)(.)\\2\\1")
matches3
```

```{r}
string4 = c("abba", "cccc","chhc","papa","paap","coco","church","yaya","yaay","dada","dadaegeg","dadadada","abaa","aaaabbbb", "a1a1")
matches4 = str_extract_all(string4, "(..)\\1")
matches4
                           
```
The answer:
The answer to each part follows.

1)(.)\1\1: The same character appearing three times in a row. E.g. "aaa"
2)"(.)(.)\\2\\1": A pair of characters followed by the same pair of characters in reversed order. E.g. "abba".
3)(..)\1: Any two characters repeated. E.g. "a1a1".
4)"(.).\\1.\\1": A character followed by any character, the original character, any other character, the original character again. E.g. "abaca", "b8b.b".
5)"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1" Three characters followed by zero or more characters of any kind followed by the same three characters but in reverse order. E.g. "abcsgasgddsadgsdgcba" or "abccba" or "abc1cba".


Question 4

#Construct regular expressions to match words that:
#Start and end with the same character.
#Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)
#Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)

```{r}
Q_list= list("dad","eye","london","papa","arm","newyork","arizona","church","tomato","baba","tio","rawr","mom","wow","pop","fun", "encourage", "remember", "noon","sense","banana","octogon","habibi","kefir","genes","economic")
```

```{r}
Q_list
```
Answer 1
```{r}
str_view(string = Q_list, pattern = "^(.)((.*\\1$)|\\1?$)" )
```
Answer Question4_2
```{r}
str_subset(Q_list, "([A-Za-z][A-Za-z]).*\\1")
```
AnswerQuestion4_3

str_subset(Q_list, "([a-z]).*\\1.*\\1")
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
